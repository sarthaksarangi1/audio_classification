# Global Data Science Challenge
## THE BIODIVERSITY BUZZ

üåç Welcome to the 6th edition of the Global Data Science Challenge: The Biodiversity Buzz! ü¶óüêù

We are thrilled to have you join us in this exhilarating Data Science competition where we embark on a fascinating journey into the realm of insects and their enchanting world of sounds. Get ready to put your Data Science skills to the test as we dive deep into the remarkable biodiversity of our planet!

In this year's challenge, we invite you to unravel the mysteries of nature by classifying a diverse range of insects based solely on the sounds they produce. As we all know, insects communicate with each other through a myriad of buzzing, chirping, and trilling sounds, which provide vital information about their species, behavior, and ecological roles. Your task will be to develop innovative algorithms that can accurately identify and classify these insect species based on their distinct audio signatures.

Why focus on insects, you may wonder? Well, insects play a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of ecosystems worldwide. They are not only fascinating creatures but also essential pollinators, decomposers, and indicators of environmental health. By studying their sounds and understanding their diversity, we gain valuable insights into the intricate web of life that surrounds us.

Throughout this challenge, you will have the opportunity to work with an extensive dataset containing audio recordings of 66 different insect species. Your mission is to analyze these recordings, extract relevant features, and build powerful models capable of predicting the species of insects based on their unique sound patterns. This will require a combination of signal processing techniques, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms.

But this challenge is not just about competition; it's also about collaboration and learning from each other. As part of the Global Data Science Challenge community, you'll have the chance to connect with talented data scientists from all corners of the globe. Engage in vibrant discussions, exchange ideas, and inspire each other to push the boundaries of Data Science.

So, gear up, embrace the buzz, and get ready to embark on this incredible Data Science adventure. The Global Data Science Challenge: The Biodiversity Buzz awaits your ingenuity, creativity, and problem-solving skills. Let's come together to make a real impact on our understanding of biodiversity and contribute to the conservation of these incredible creatures.

Good luck to all participants, and may the Data Science powers be with you! üöÄüêûüåø

## What can you find in this repo?

Here's a breakdown of what you'll discover in this repository:

- Notebooks: The "notebooks" folder contains a collection of five thoughtfully crafted tutorials. These tutorials serve as your expert guides, presenting you with step-by-step instructions and insights into potential solutions. Delve into data exploration, feature engineering, and model building, as these Jupyter notebooks provide a solid foundation for understanding the problem at hand and developing effective strategies.

- src (Source Code): Within the "src" folder, you will find a suite of custom libraries prepared exclusively for this competition. These libraries have been meticulously designed to streamline your Data Science workflow, offering functions and utilities that accelerate your progress. Leveraging these tailored resources allows you to focus more on the core aspects of your solution, ultimately saving you precious time and effort.

- shell_scripts: The "shell_scripts" folder hosts two essential bash scripts specifically created to help you optimize costs when utilizing AWS SageMaker. The first script automates the process of cleaning your storage in SageMaker Studio, enabling you to avoid unnecessary expenses. The second script monitors and manages notebook instances, automatically stopping idle instances after a period of inactivity, thus reducing resource consumption and optimizing costs. These scripts empower you to make the most of AWS SageMaker while keeping your expenses under control.

By combining the tutorials, custom libraries, and cost-saving scripts provided in this repository, you have a powerful toolkit at your disposal. Use these resources to explore different approaches, experiment with innovative techniques, and collaborate with fellow participants.

We encourage you to regularly check for updates in the repository and actively engage in discussions to foster a vibrant and collaborative community. Share your insights, exchange ideas, and support each other throughout the competition journey.

Remember, the Global Data Science Challenge is not just a competition; it is an opportunity to expand your knowledge, refine your skills, and make a meaningful contribution to our understanding of biodiversity. So, embrace the challenge, let your creativity soar, and embark on this extraordinary Data Science adventure.

Wishing you the best of luck in the competition! üöÄüêûüåø
